# Hello World App

Example [torchbear](https://gitlab.com/polytopes/torchbear) application.

Install [peru](https://github.com/buildinspace/peru) and run `peru sync` to set up the dependencies, and then run `torchbear` to start this application, you can also run `torchbear <app-directory>` from any other directory.

If you want to develop in *torchbear-ext*, you need to clone it elsewhere and run `peru override add torchbear_ext <path-to-torchbear-ext-clone>`, and then `peru sync` after every change in the *torchbear-ext* clone.
